	With java, we can create whole new ways to make common things easier to do. The most it would help in a future situation is when you are either a java developer, working in a coding company or a manager for one of them. Even if you aren't coding in java, it would help to learn another coding language if you already know one.These people take up a significant amount of jobs in the world. If this isn't enough, java also improves a humans way of processing knowledge. The world is evolving around coding and electronics in this generation. Anything is possible with electricity and the power of the human mind. For example, cashiers won't need to put in all the numbers for a big customer anymore, an app can inteprate what the customer shopped and with a table of items in the shop, he can just tell the customer what he needs instead of constantly typing in numbers. This is just one of thousands of jobs possibly improved with coding and java.
