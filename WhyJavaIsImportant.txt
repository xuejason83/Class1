Java is a very important skill because technology is getting more and more advanced, and it's pretty clear that technology will be even more important and used more often
in the future, which makes coding an essential skill for the future. There are many different languages in coding, but Java is by far the most superior. It is one of the 
most used language in the world, and it can be used for many different things. A language like Python is also really good, but it's too simple, and can't be used to create
as complex programs as Java can, which makes Java superior. That is why Java can and will be used for many things in the future, which makes it an essential skill to learn.
